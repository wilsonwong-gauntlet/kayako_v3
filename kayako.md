Kayako AI Call Assistant – Product Requirements
Understand the Problem
We want to create a system where:
Kayako can automatically answer incoming customer calls using AI.
The system retrieves answers from a connected knowledge base.
If an answer is found, the AI responds in real-time on the call.
If an answer is not found, the AI ends the call by informing the caller that an expert will follow up.
A ticket is created in Kayako with the full call context, including key details like email and call transcript.

Key Components Needed
Voice AI System
Ability to answer and process incoming calls.
Human-like speech synthesis and natural language understanding (NLU).
Knowledge Base Integration
AI retrieves relevant responses from the knowledge base via API.
Call Handling Logic
Determines whether an answer is found.
Ends call if no answer is available and triggers expert follow-up.
Kayako API Integration
Creates a ticket with call details, including transcript and caller information.
User Data Capture
Collects key details such as caller’s email and reason for calling.

User Flow Overview
A customer calls the support line.
Kayako AI answers the call using human-like speech.
The AI extracts key details (e.g., email, issue description).
It searches the knowledge base for a relevant answer.
If an answer is found → AI delivers the response in real-time.
If no answer is found → AI informs the caller that a human agent will follow up.
The system ends the call and automatically creates a Kayako support ticket.
A human agent reviews the ticket and follows up as needed.

Example User Experience

No Answer Found Scenario
